# Solutions to adventofcode.com

## 2015-2018
Very few solutions here.

## 2019
Mostly complete, but many source files won't work for part 1 without some hacking. The code progressed to solve part 2 and in some cases I didn't preserve the ability to compute part 1.

## 2020
Took a more structured approach and attempted to make each source file output exactly two strings, the solutions for each part.

To run tests:
```
2020 $ ruby tests/*_test.rb
```
